If Google Authentication Doesn't Work (Most Likely Wouldn't), Continue Without Google Auth, I made it work for localhost but I dont know how to deploy the Node Server on Vercel.Also The Webpage is not integrated with Firebase beacuse I simply dont know about firebase much at the moment,and I had to complete the Task within the time constraints.
(Won't say its my best work,but I tried to give my best)

The Webpage is currently being hosted on vercel -

# Taskify

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
